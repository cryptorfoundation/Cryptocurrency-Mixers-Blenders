Cryptocurrency Mixers &amp; Blenders

Overview
Some people using Bitcoin are looking to get a real privacy and this is where bitcoin mixing service websites are useful.

Privacy is a right, not a privilege.

Prior to the advent of trustless alternatives, mixing services (also called tumblers) were used to mix one’s funds with other people’s money, intending to confuse the trail back to the funds’ original source. In traditional financial systems, the equivalent would be moving funds through banks located in countries with strict bank-secrecy laws.

When you use a bitcoin mixer, you send your money to an anonymous service and, if it is well-built, it will send you anonymous coins back.

I am going to try to update a list of Bitcoin mixers/tumblers websites frequently. It will be sorted from the best to the worst.
